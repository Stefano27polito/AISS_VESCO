\section{VDRs}

The VDR is essentially a system that stores and manages (allows also revocation of) public keys.\\ 
All these information, inside VDR, are used to verify the authenticity and the status of verifiable credentials and DIDs.\\
\\

\noindent
It can be implemented with various technology.\\
Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as blockchains or Tangles are widely considered the most suitable basis for Verifiable Data Registries (VDRs), as they ensure \textit{immutability} and \textit{persistence} 
of information, preventing unauthorized modifications.
